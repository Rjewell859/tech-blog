## Description

This is a tech blog that allows software engineers to make posts in order to ask questions or share their knowledge. Users are able to view
all of the posts collectively on the home page. When a post is clicked the post is displayed by itself with some more descriptive content as well
as options to add comments. A user can create an account and sign in as well, and they will be signed in for a limited period
of time if idle. When signed in a user can post from their dashboard, or delete a post. Users are able to comment on other users posts and delete 
their comments.

## Installation

Use MySQL to run schema.sql to create the database, then use npm run seed to seed the database.

### Usage

Start the server and make an account to proceed. Make a post from the dashboard or view other posts.
